<h2>The Difference Between Different Programming Languages</h2>

    C++ Language
    
    The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times.This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree
    C++ Language

    C Language
    
    The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster . However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.

    Pascal Language
    
    Pascal language is mostly a teaching language and few industries uses this language to write the programs. This language tends to use keywords instead of symbols and braces in C language. So this language is very easy for beginners to understand than a programming language like C, C++. Borland is a compiler software company, which is using Delphi programming language for industrial strength. Delphi is an object oriented language of Pascal, and presently  Borland compilers only use it.

    Fortran Language
    
    Fortran language is a number crunching language and still it is used by scientists. This language allows different sizes of variables up to the memory limit in the machine. This language is suitable for engineers, who have to calculate values with high precision. Program in Fortran is inflexible and sometimes it makes difficult to read.

    Java Language
    
    The Java language is a multi platform language that’s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.
    Java Language
    
    Java Language
    Perl Language
    
    Perl language is a file management language for UNIX. But it is more popular for its common gateway interface programming (CGI). It is a term for programs that web servers can perform to allow additional capabilities of web pages. Pearl language is a method for searching text and it is used for useful server functions and other databases, and it is very easy to pick up the fundamentals if you have any experience in any language. As a CGi language, web hosting services select Perl language over C++ language. Because, the web hosts can review Perl script files. Since they are text files, when C++ is compiled.

    PHP Language
    
    The PHP language is used to design web pages and sometimes it is also used as scripting language. This language is designed to develop a rapid website, and as a result comprises features which make it easy generate HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting language, it includes a set of components permit the programmer to easily get up to speed. However, it has more  sophisticated object oriented features.
    PHP Language
    
    PHP Language
    LISP Language
    
    LISP language is mostly used in computer science research and it stores all data in lists such as arrays. The syntax of list is very simple and easy to make for developers to implement structures.
    LISP Language
    
    LISP Language
    Scheme Language
    
    The scheme language is an alternate of LISP language, and it has a simpler syntax and features. Any project under the scheme language will result in the re implementation of most of the  LISP language. But, this is very popular introductory language in the computer science department of MIT’s. This language easily solves the problems instead of worrying about syntaxes of programming language.

    This is all about the differences between programming languages and few major programming languages are discussed. And, the remaining languages like Tcl, Python, Smalltalk, COBOL, C# and Prolog are similar to the above languages which are discussed. But selecting the suitable language for developing a program or application is very important
